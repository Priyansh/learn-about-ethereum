## Glossary

_Loosely ordered by importance_

__Ethereum__: Public blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. Povides a decentralized virtual machine that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH)

__Ether (ETH)__: The instrinsic currency for Ethereum

__Blockchain__: A distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block

__Gas__: The price for running a transaction or contract in Ethereum.

__Mining__: The computational work neccessary to validify and secure the Ethereum network. 

__Ethereum Wallet__: Gateway to hold ether and use smart contracts on Ethereum

__Ethereum browser__: Software to browse and use DApps on Ethereum

__DApp__: Decentralized app

__[Parity](https://ethcore.io/parity.html)__: Ethereum browser that integrates directly into your web browser

__[Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist)__: Ethereum browser with integrated wallet

__[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)__: Programming language for writing euthereum contracts

__Wei__: Smallest subdenomination of Ether, the one in which all integer values of the currency are counted. 1 ether = 10<sup>18</sup> Wei (1,000,000,000,000,000,000)

__Szabo__: Currency demoniation for 10<sup>15</sup> Wei (1,000,000,000,000,000)

__Finney__: Currency demoniation for 10<sup>12</sup> Wei  (1,000,000,000,000)

__Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)__: An organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts.

__Ethereum Homestead Documentation ([ethdocs.org](http://www.ethdocs.org))__: Community-run non-official Ethereum documentation

__Ethereum Name Service (ENS)__: Distributed naming system via domains .eth and .test

__Hard fork__: A hard fork is a change to the underlying Ethereum protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. All Ethereum clients need to upgrade; otherwise they will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules.

__Smart contracts__: Pieces of code that live on the blockchain and execute commands exactly how they were told to. 

__Ethereum World Computer__: Vision of Ethereum to create a decentralized world computer. _Contracts_ provide decentralized logic, _Swarm_ provides decentralized storage, and _Whisper_ provides decentralized messaging.

__[Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper)__: Decentralized communication protocol for DApps to communicate with each other.

__Swarm__: Distributed storage platform and content distribution service for DApps to serve content. 

__Proof-of-work (PoW)__: Algorithm for reaching consensus on the blockchain via mining to process transactions, considered expensive and inefficient. Ethereum network currently uses a _proof-of-work_ algorithm with plans to develop and move to a _proof-of-stake_ algorithm.

__Proof-of-stake (PoS)__: Algorithm for reaching consensus on the blockchain without mining. Agreement measured on the basis of how much digital currency agrees with the current state. Currently in research and development.

__[geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth)__: Command-line interface for running a full ethereum node

__[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)__: Official Go implementation

__[web 3 (web3.js)](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)__: Ethereum JavaScript API

__[cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)__: C++ client

__[ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj)__: Java implementation

__[pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum)__: Python core library

__ethOS__: Linux OS designed to mine Ethereum

__Frontier__: First major release of th Ethereum platform

__Homestead__: Second major version release of the Ethereum platform

__Metropolis__: Third major version release of the Ethereum platform

__Serenity__: Fourth major release of Ethereum. Intended to have two major feature sets: [abstraction](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/05/on-abstraction/) and Casper

__Casper__: Proof-of-stake algorithm in development for Serenity

__Ethash__: Current proof-of-work algorithm for Ethereum

__Testnet__: A private blockchain separate from the main Ethereum network designed for testing.

__Olympic__: Pre-release testnet launched in early 2015, sometimes referred to as Ethereum Version 0.9

__Morden__: First first full release testnet launched in parallel with Ethereum 1.0 in July 2015

__Ropsten__: Latest testnet launched in November 2016 replacing the bugged Morden testnet, currently running the latest Homestead release of Ethereum
