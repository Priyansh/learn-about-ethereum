## Glossary

_Ordered by importance._

__Ethereum__: Public blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. Povides a decentralized virtual machine that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH)

__Blockchain__: A distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block

__Ether (ETH)__: Instrinsic currency for Ethereum

__Mining__: The word mining originates in the context of the gold analogy for crypto currencies. Gold or precious metals are scarce, so are digital tokens, and the only way to increase the total volume is through mining it.

__Ethereum Wallet__: Gateway to hold ether and use smart contracts on Ethereum

__DApp__: Decentralized app

__Ethereum browser__: Software to browse and use DApps on Ethereum

__[Parity](https://ethcore.io/parity.html)__: Ethereum browser that integrates directly into your web browser

__[Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist)__: Ethereum browser with integrated wallet

__[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)__: Programming language for writing euthereum contracts

__Wei__: Smallest subdenomination of Ether, the one in which all integer values of the currency are counted. 1 ether = 10<sup>18</sup> Wei (1,000,000,000,000,000,000)

__Szabo__: Currency demoniation for 10<sup>15</sup> Wei (1,000,000,000,000,000)

__Finney__: Currency demoniation for 10<sup>12</sup> Wei  (1,000,000,000,000)

__Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)__: An organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts.

__Ethereum Homestead Documentation ([ethdocs.org](http://www.ethdocs.org))__: Community-run non-official Ethereum documentation

__Ethereum Name Service (ENS)__: Distributed naming system via domains .eth and .test

__Hard fork__: A hard fork is a change to the underlying Ethereum protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. All Ethereum clients need to upgrade; otherwise they will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules.

__Smart contracts__: Pieces of code that live on the blockchain and execute commands exactly how they were told to. 

__Ethereum World Computer__: Vision of Ethereum to create a decentralized world computer. _Contracts_ provide decentralized logic, _Swarm_ provides decentralized storage, and _Whisper_ provides decentralized messaging.

__[Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper)__: Decentralized communication protocol for DApps to communicate with each other.

__Swarm__: Distributed storage platform and content distribution service for DApps to serve content. 

__Proof-of-work (PoW)__: Algorithm for reaching consensus on the blockchain via mining to process transactions, considered expensive and inefficient. Ethereum network currently uses a _proof-of-work_ algorithm with plans to develop and move to a _proof-of-stake_ algorithm.

__Proof-of-stake (PoS)__: Algorithm for reaching consensus on the blockchain without mining. Agreement measured on the basis of how much digital currency agrees with the current state. Currently in research and development.

__[geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth)__: Command-line interface for running a full ethereum node

__[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)__: Official Go implementation

__[web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)__: Ethereum JavaScript API

__[cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)__: C++ client

__[ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj)__: Java implementation

__[pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum)__: Python core library

__ethOS__: Linux OS designed to mine Ethereum

__Homestead__: Second major version release of the Ethereum platform

__Serenity__: Next major release of Ethereum. Intended to have two major feature sets: [abstraction](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/05/on-abstraction/) and Casper

__Casper__: Proof-of-stake algorithm in development for Serenity

__Ethash__: Current proof-of-work algorithm for Ethereum

__Morden__: First alternative testnet for Ethereum
